# battleship.js

A browser-based take on the classic boardgame, battleship.js is a project that I worked on for fun to learn javascript and jQuery. Enjoy! 

## Play the game

## Things to Do:

There are a lot of things to do to make this project even better. I've divided the work into bugs to fix and addition work, which tend to be more of code writing.

### Bugs to fix:
<ol>
	<li><strike>make cells with the 'miss' class display 'miss' css styles, so background is white</strike></li>
	<li><strike>prevent cells from have multiple instances of the 'miss' or 'hit' class</strike></li>
	<li> fix the links in this read me file</li>
	<li><strike>initialize new game does not reset ship_container, just keeps added a new set of ships</strike></li>
</ol>


### Additional work:
<ul>
	<li>!! Make is mobile-responsive!!</li><ol>
		<li> add event listeners for touch</li>
	</ol>
	<li> Retouch up the design </li>
	<li>write a game over function <ol>
		<li> alert user when all ships are sunk </li>
		<li> freeze button clicking </li>
	</ol></li>

	<li>Add user data to the game <ol>
		<li> keep tracks of number of guess </li>
